# VIEH-Group-Project
Project Statement: Predict the life expectancy of the person.

What do you need to build: Based on the given dataset, predict the
life expectation. You need to create a basic linear regression model
and find the linear relation between life expectancy and other
variables.


The dataset was initially obtained from the World
Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Websites. Data
contains features such as year, status, life expectancy, adult
mortality, infant deaths, percentage of expenditure, and alcohol
consumption. Create a simple Linear Regression model to predict life
expectancy.
